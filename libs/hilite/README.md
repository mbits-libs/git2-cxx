# Highlighting library
## hilite
This library sets up basic highlighting scheme, common "marker colors" and infrastructure for specific language tokenizer to produce colors. The `cell` part stands for **`C`**`onst`**`E`**`xpr` **LL** parser and is inspired by Boost.Spirit X3.

## hilite-*
Provides highlighting for any given language; wedged between `hilite` and `lighter`

## lighter
Lighter is high-level API for text highlighting (also, here all the `cell`/`hilite`/`hilite-*` tests live)
